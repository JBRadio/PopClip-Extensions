# PopClip Extensions

Here, I will try to post extensions that I've created and perhaps link to some noteworthy ones outside of the [PopClip Extensions](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/extensions/) page.


# HTML Notepad.popclipext

If you open a new tab and execute the following in the address bar, you can make the current HTML document editable:

data:text/html,<textarea style='font-size: 1.5em; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none; outline: none;' placeholder='Type here' autofocus />

It doesn't need to be <textarea> ... You can look it up online. Others have made additional features like syntax highlighting, etc. This is very simple taking basically default features.

Benefits:

* Repurpose an application you are already using, the browser, to be a simple notetaking application.
* Save extension/add-on bar space for more functional items.
* Works with PopClip!
