# PopClip Extensions

Here, I will try to post extensions that I've created and perhaps link to some noteworthy ones outside of the [PopClip Extensions](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/extensions/) page.


# HTML Notepad.popclipext

If you open a new tab and execute the following in the address bar, you can make the current HTML document editable (basically we are using the Data :

data:text/html, &lt;html contenteditable&gt;

Also:

data:text/html,&lt;textarea style='font-size: 1.5em; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none; outline: none;' placeholder='Type here' autofocus /&gt;

Others have made additional features like syntax highlighting, etc. This PopClip extension only uses the very basic of features (see the textarea example above).

##Benefits:

* Repurpose an application you are already using, the browser, to be a simple notetaking application.
* Save extension/add-on bar space for more functional items.
* Works with PopClip!

##Credits:

I am not the original person who found out this trick however the code is standard and should work in most, if not all, browsers. I first found it on Coderwall.com.
